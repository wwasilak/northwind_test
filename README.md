Mini project : testing Malloy language on Northwind dataset by answering Curbal's 25 Days of DAX ( https://curbal.com/25-days-of-dax-fridays-challenge-ed1-northwind-company )

For this project i am using CSV files containing Northwind database data. Files come from https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-examples/tree/master/examples/northwind/data/csv

Two notebooks were created for this project:
1. DataTransformation.malloysql - raw csv files transformed to parquet files
2. 25DaysDaxNotebook.malloynb - model + answers

Notebooks can be accessed using browser version of Vscode on .malloynb or .malloysql file (enter the file and press '.' on your keyboard).

The source to learn about Malloy language:
https://malloydata.github.io/documentation/

I highly advise to visit Slack channel where Malloy's creators quickly answer all questions:
